            <p> Hi my name is Atlas Zimmermann. I am currently a freshman at Purdue University- West Lafayette majoring in Audio Engineering. I just graduated from Perry Meridian Highschool where I was two-time class president, vice-president of Tri-M, a member of NHS and SHH, a multiple time state gold cellist, and much more. I have participated in many skill building activities such as Nextech and RYLA that have allowed me to train to become a leader of tomorrow. No matter the challenge I face it with determination and perserverance.
